		<p> 
Phil shuffled about in his seat nervously<br>
He had a feeling he wouldn't be able to show off any of the rhyming slang he'd prepared <br>
"and what about 9/11 Phil, are you gonna apologise for that?" <br>
The journo sneered, he was enjoying this, all the boys were. <br>
"yes, well obviously my heart goes out-"<br>
Before he could finish another chipped in. <br>
"and the treatment of the Yemenese in the 60's?" <br>
"well of course-"<br>
And another; it was lion's at the watering hole at this point<br>
"Will you finally own up and apologise for the extermination Troglodytes?"<br>
Sweat dripped down Mickleson's face, he looked towards Norman stood at the back of the room for a way out<br>
but Greg just shook his head and wiped his arse with a £50 note. <br>
