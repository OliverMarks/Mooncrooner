		<h5>11/11/2011 </h5>
		<p> Since Boris Johnson finally bid ‘Hasta la vista baby’ to the country after apparently largely completing his mission - If his mission was to destroy public trust in politicians, degrade accountability of those who represent us and deliver a Brexit deal so fraught with issues that his own government doesn't seem to view it as legally binding, oh and sleepwalk the economy into a cost of living crisis, it's hard to disagree with his assessment of a job well done - candidates from across the Conservative party have come forward with the belief that if that idiot could lead the country maybe they could to. <br><br>

			Weeks of ferocious battling have followed sorting the chaps from the chaff and the grand hive mind of the parliamentary Conservative Party have now selected their champions. The race to <mark>resurrect Margaret Thatcher</mark> is down to the final two. In the blue corner, Rishi ‘Dishy’ Sunak, the man of the people who understands your pain as he also struggles with his immense wealth. In the bluer corner, Liz ‘odd-ball’ Truss who is attempting to become the first programmed synth to take the highest office in the land. As one Downing Street source put it: one’s a snake, the other is a moron. <br><br>
			
			It’s been a heated contest so far with both candidates keen to trash each other’s records in government as well as their personal qualities. Truss, a former remainer and liberal democrat <mark>(and probably a Man City fan from way before the takeover)</mark>, has a proven track record of bending her staunch conservative values into the shape of whatever will further her career. According to supporters her record speaks for itself; although I've yet to hear it say "doing the job just well enough not to get sacked in a cabinet of pure medicority". She's quick to point to success landing trade deals with Australia and Japan, who were probably equally as pleased Truss led the way and allowed them to walk all over a Brexit bruised UK. <br><br>
			
			Sunak has remained in the limelight throughout his time as Chancellor, once beloved for allowing hundreds of thousands of us to enjoy a couple extra Katsu curries at Wagamama in the midst of a pandemic, the MP for <mark>Richmond’s</mark> starlight has dimmed somewhat in recent times due to betrayal of Bojo at the end of his premiership. Rishi seemed to back the PM when public opinion had thoroughly turned against him and his resignation came too late to possibly claim to have been an act of integrity. In a surprisingly refreshing turn of events the final two candidates have no qualms about a bit of ‘blue on blue’ bashing so their personal and policy differences have been laid bare for all to see. Let’s take a look at a couple of key issues to demonstrate the point: <br><br>
			
			
			<b>The Economy</b><br> 
			Unsurprisingly the economy has been front and centre of the debate so far and the place the candidates are most dramatically opposed. When it comes to tax cuts the Truss-bot Thatcher algorithm is on rampage mode rolling back national insurance hikes and reversing the corporation tax rise due in 2023. Not even the environment is safe from the human hand grenade, Truss is happy to both negatively impact Net Zero ambitions and Treasury income (by £5bill) in order to save each household £150 a year. Her plans would include finding savings from the public sector having claimed she would save taxpayers £11bn by cutting civil service time off, ending national pay deals and scrapping jobs aimed at increasing inclusion and diversity in the public sector - much to the relief of all public sector workers who have seen benefits packages continually hacked away and successive governments deliver measly pay deals that fail to keep up with anything. <br><br>
			
			
			Sunak is quick to emphasise in his stump speech to members that he understands how to turn around the economy because he balanced the books in his mother's pharmacy. As well as perhaps the surprising omission that being Chancellor for 2 years hasn’t added to this understanding, we'll also ignore the fact that most pharmacies lack any of the tools a government has to pull the levers of an economy by printing money, reasonably sustain debt or tackle external forces such as inflation. Have no fear, sensible Sunak, who just so happens to have been the man at the wheel of the economy for the past 2years has figured out the solution just in time for a leadership contest and it's time to get radical - If by radical you actually mean slightly tweak the planned cuts and rely on calling the other plan fairy tale economics.  <mark>Perhaps more BAU than BMX.</mark><br><br>
			
			
			<b>Immigration</b><br> 
			Rishi is fully behind the much maligned ‘Rwanda Plan’ and has pledged to do ‘whatever it takes’ to make it work; one assumes this will include lending one of his private jets to ship out those war fleeing leeches on society. Without a stitch of irony at all, the former chancellor, who’s parents immigrated to the country themselves, has decided enough is enough and it’s time we only let in the best and brightest - the rest are Rwanda’s (and its chequered human rights record) problem.<br><br>
			
			Truss also supports the Rwanda policy but feels the current destination options are limited so wants to expand it to more countries - presumably to include the Yemen, <mark>DR Congo</mark> and North Korea . In addition she has pledged not to ‘cower’ to the ECHR, the European jugger-court determined to protect human and fundamental rights at the cost of loose and easy government. What exactly this would entail is anyone’s guess seeing as leaving the convention would not only go against the Good Friday agreement but also the Brexit agreement both candidates are so proud of BoJo getting done.   <br><br>
			
			
			
			As both candidates pander to the wants and needs to 150,000  mostly male, white, leave voting, middle class, southerners, it’s a legitimate question to ask what mandate they will actually gain from this all? They will both be courting a demographic largely unlike the rest of the nation they are seeking to lead. How much redmeat will need to be given to the right of the party in order to win and how many of these off the cuff policies will actually be enacted and who will hold them to account if they are not? Sunak claims that he’s the only one that can win an election but right now he’s struggling to win over his own core support. With such a tepid opposition <mark>the party could stand the actual corpse of Thatcher and still run things pretty close.</mark> For all his many flaws at least Bojo was a figure that transcended his party and through pure force of personality was able to appeal to voters on all sides of the political spectrum. <br><br>
			
			As this drawn out contest continues the nation watches on with baited breath for the results due on the 5th September. <br><br>
