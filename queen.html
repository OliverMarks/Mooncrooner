		<h5>11/11/2011 </h5>
		<p> 
			In light of the tragic passing of Queen Elizabeth II, the country's longest serving monarch, the nation has entered a period of mourning. Throughout the country memorial events, touching tributes and moments of reflection are being held by her majesty's grieving subjects. In addition to these gestures from individuals and communities, businesses and associations are following the example of the Football Association and are showing their respects in their own ways. For those trying to navigate these difficult times, we have pulled together a list of notable acts from corporations in order to help you plan accordingly. <br><br>

<b>Dreams, BedstoreUK and bedfactorydirect</b> <br>
All three major retailers have ceased the selling of Queen sized beds as a mark of respect to her majesty. The pause will last throughout the period of mourning but customers can take advantage of a sale of King size beds in celebration of Charles III. LandofBeds have also included bunk beds in their sale in a move many see as a reference to the new King and Camilla’s alleged sleeping arrangements. <br><br>

<b>English Chess Federation</b> <br>
Despite calls for all tournaments to be postponed the ECF will continue to hold competitions throughout the period of mourning. Players have been asked to avoid touching the Queen piece if possible and under no circumstances threaten their opponents King as a sign of respect. <br><br>

<b>Pumpers Freshers Week Events</b><br>
The controversial event organisers Pumpers have said all freshers week events will go ahead as planned including those planned for the day of Elizabeth II’s funeral. A key part of these nights are the wet t-shirt competitions which have come under increased scrutiny in recent years. Participants at the competitions this year will be given a large temporary tattoo of the queen to be worn under their shirts and ultimately reveal the winner as a sign of respect. <br><br>

<b>Royal Mail </b><br>
The Royal Mail will not be delivering any post containing a stamp of the Queen on the day of the funeral. A spokesperson for the organisation released the following statement regarding the decision: <i>“the notion of forcing the image of her majesty through a dutty old letter box during what will be such a difficult day for many is likely to be upsetting to the public”</i>. <br><br>


<b>HM The Mount Prison</b> <br>
As a mark of respect the Hertfordshire prison will no longer be showing the advertised ‘Dumb and Dumber’ marathon on Sunday night. Instead, occupants of the prison, now spending time at <i>his</i> majesties pleasure, will be invited to stare at a picture of the queen for the same duration of the films. <br><br>



<b>Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals</b> <br>
The NNU Hospital trust announced on Friday that it will be switching off all life support machines on the day of the funeral due to what it has described as “disrespectful beeping sounds”. Patients requiring the use of their life support machines during that time have been asked to make other arrangements or do without for her majesty’s sake. <br><br>

<b>The Lizardmen of Lustria</b><br>
In an announcement largely ignored by mainstream media, the Lizardmen (aka the Cold Ones or Children of the Gods) have entered a period of mourning. The ancient race known for their relentless endeavour to restore order in the name of the Old Ones, and unleashing their cold-blooded savagery upon any that stand in their way, are believed to be preparing an ascension ceremony for their new leader known in Saurian as ‘Chaq-Lot’.
