		<h2 class="blogpost"> Time to pay through the bottle-nose: high time for dolphins to pay tax? </h2>
	
		<h5>11/11/2011 </h5>
		<p> 
			As the global economy tries to get back on track after the economic effects of COVID diminish, those on the left and right of the political spectrum are once again returning to the thorny issue of the taxation of marine wildlife, but why does this such topic continue to trouble lawmakers and are there legitimate grounds for such a tariff? 
			<br><br>
			Despite obvious moral dilemmas such a tax presents and issues with enforcement, proponents argue marine wildlife have been given a free ride in recent times and it’s time they paid their way in today’s society. Cliff Wiggle of the right leaning 'Insitute of Economic Porpoise Research Centre' argues there’s precedent for reform and now more than ever it is vital governments look to alternative revenue streams to avoid budget deficits that plagued the 2010’s: 
	<blockquote><i>"Historically, societies have always taken a holistic approach to taxation and have not shied away from making tough decisions on extra-species tariffs. We are not suggesting anything new here, just that marine life contribute their fair share, we tax the poor, why not dolphins?"</i></blockquote> 

Indeed, such taxation policies have been present throughout history: During Emperor Nero’s reign the Romans enforced a tributun on all dolphins and whales living in Roman territory that owned beachside properties. The allelengyon enforced by the Byzantians in 1002AD compelled larger marine wildlife to distribute wealth to smaller creatures (with the exception of crabs who had negotiated an exception). Even in more recent times a whale tithe was enforced by Emperor Hirohito throughout the 1950s to stave off over zealous Japanese whalers operating in the Pacific Ocean. 
<br> <br>
Janice Flowder from the pressure group 'We can’t tax dolphins ffs (WCTDF)'finds such examples laughable and points to little evidence of them ever yielding success: 
	<blockquote><i>“Those on the right will cite historical incidences of taxation but will never provide any evidence that such policies raised a single penny for those in power. It’s ludicrous that the WCTDF even has to exist in 2022; if anything we owe marine wildlife for years of environmental destruction."</i></blockquote> 
Despite these complaints some governments are pushing on with efforts to tap into this revenue stream.  All eyes will be on the recently announced pilot scheme in El Salvador which will require all marine wildlife to pay migration polls. Controversially the pilot requires all sea life (with the exception of crabs who have negotiated an exception) to register bitcoin wallets before the trial begins in Dec 2022. Early reports suggest uptake has been slow and critics of the scheme have questioned the El Salvadorian government’s pledge to incarcerate those who have not complied in state of the art ‘aqua-prisons’.
<br> <br>
One leader sure to be keeping an eye on the success of the trial will be Boris Johnson. EU law is explicit in the restrictions it places upon member states in regards to taxation measures aimed at non-humans but, since the country left the union, the UK PM has called for a review of existing legislation to see where the country could expand its remit in this area. This would appease vocal backbench MPs such as Mark Francois (who is rumoured to actually be a family of Japanese whalers stuffed inside the shell of a small, tiny penis’d, angry little man - a claim we should point out Mr Francois has yet to deny) and provide funding for 2023’s Eurovision song contest. 
		<br><br>
With compromise seemining unlikely on either side, this debate looks set to rage on into the 2020’s and is sure to be a hot topic at the next election.

		<i><b>Correction: An earlier version of this blog incorrectly reported that Mark Francois (MP) and Andrew Brigend (MP) had been seen ‘lady and the tramping’ a dolphin’s blowhole in the House of Commons smoking area. This was entirely false and Mooncrooner apologises for any distress caused by such an image.</i></b>
