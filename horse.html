		<h5>11/11/2011 </h5>
		<p> 
			It is a fact almost universally known among Brits that Henry VIII was a man about town, with six wives and numerous rumoured mistresses throughout his reign, news of discovery of another lover, though interesting, would not shake the foundations of our understanding of the King; however, claims of a new discovery in the correspondence of close aids to the king has added weight to the theory that this may not in fact be the case. The existence of this mistresses may come as a surprise to most but, for a small subset of Historians and Tudor enthusiasts, it brings back to the spotlight a conspiracy that has quietly been gathering support since the time of his reign itself. 

<br><br>Known as the ‘Henry Only Really Shagged Equines Theory (HORSE Theory) it is claimed that Henry VIII had a long and passionate affair with one of his horses over the course of 15 years. Dismissed by prominent Tudor historians as utter nonsense lacking a single shred of tangible evidence, HORSE Theory proponents now believe  they have their smoking gun to prove its existence.  <br><br>

Professor Bunny Snags, Head of Equine History at Binghamton University and Chairman of the HORSE Society has spent years trawling through the correspondence of the court throughout the Henry’s reign looking for evidence of the affair:

<blockquote>“For centuries we merely had feint wafts of clues that this affair had taken place: etchings on wooden beams, symbolic erotic equine additions to royal portraits and second hand accounts of unusual riding positions; but now we have irrutiable, written evidence from those working close to the King that he had a horsed lover” </blockquote>

The excerpts Prof Snags refers to are from letters sent by Jane Skipwith, a maid to Henry’s court in Windsor Castle, to her cousin in the spring of 1527: 

<blockquote class="cursiveQuote"><i>My best beloued cosen I am v^e^ry glad to here from you, that you ar well, and I would haue you thinke that it tis one of the greates[t] comfordes I haue in this world to here of your well farer; I am very sory to here that your father is still in that humer of offering you more wifes; but as for this; shee hathe a greate porshone; wich I thinke if I hade; hee would not so much missl[i]ke of mee as hee dothe; and besides shee is honorabell wich dothe goe fare with most men nowe dayes; but I protest I writ not this out of any mistrust I haue of your loue; for I haue euer found it more then I haue desserued; yett I know not what shall deserue; and thus with my best wishes; for your good fortune; and happy^n^es in all your bussines I rest euer 
<br><br>
your truly louing frende while I breath <br>
Jane Skipwith<br><br>

P.S I saw Big H banging that horse of his again, gastly bussines</i> </blockquote>
<br><br>

Infamously Henry’s 4th wife, Anne of Cleves, was known as the Flanders Mare, a woman Henry supposedly found so unattractive that he couldn’t bring himself to consummate their union. <br><br>

It had long been believed evidence such as the beam etchings (graffiti found at a royal residence that read: ‘Big Henry is a horse humper’) were simply school boy hijinks at Henry’s expense but Prof Snags disagrees and argues a complete reimagining of their relationship is now needed:

<blockquote>“This completely changes the way we have to interpret Henry’s relationship with Anne of Cleves, it seems apparent to me that, rather than finding Anne disgusting because she looked like a horse, it was the complete opposite, she was a reminder to him of that which he could not have, his true love, a horse”.</blockquote>


Prof Snag’s is quick to admit that there is more work to be done in order to breach the evidential burden needed to convince his peers and the public but what happens if this is achieved? Would this have any real consequence beyond providing an interesting curio for academics? We reached out to renowned constitutional lawyer and proud HORSE associate Gilbert Quaffley for his views on what real world impact this could have on the royal family today:

<blockquote>“If Henry Sired some sort of horse-man-child there could be profound constitutional ramifications for the whole of British society. There could be a rightful heir to the throne trotting, or walking depending on how the genes have evolved, with a claim overriding that of Charles’. But here’s where I think we go deeper into the rabbit hole, Charles has known about this all along and decided the best way to deal with this was to marry his potential challenger. Am I saying Camilla is a horse? Well i’m certainly not saying she isn’t”</blockquote>
